# Security Policy

## Introduction

This document outlines the security policies, practices, and guidelines for the Workflow Automation Platform. It includes information on vulnerability reporting, compliance standards, and secure development practices.

## Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to our security team at security@example.com. Include a detailed description of the issue and steps to reproduce it. We will acknowledge receipt within 24 hours and provide updates as we work to resolve the issue.

Our security team follows a structured process for handling vulnerability reports:

1. Initial Assessment (24 hours)
2. Severity Classification
3. Investigation & Validation
4. Fix Development & Testing
5. Security Patch Release
6. Post-Resolution Communication

## Compliance Standards

The platform adheres to the following industry standards:

### SOC 2 Type II
- Annual audits conducted by certified third-party auditors
- Controls for security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy
- Continuous monitoring and compliance validation

### GDPR Compliance
- Data protection by design and default
- Secure data processing and storage
- User rights management and data portability
- Regular Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA)

### ISO 27001
- Information Security Management System (ISMS)
- Risk assessment and management
- Security controls implementation
- Regular internal and external audits

## Secure Development Practices

### Code Security
- Mandatory code reviews for all changes
- Automated security scanning using static and dynamic analysis tools
- Regular dependency vulnerability scanning
- Secure coding guidelines enforcement

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with secure token management
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation
- Regular access reviews and privilege management
- Multi-factor authentication support

### Data Protection
- AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data
- Secure key management and rotation
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing

## Incident Response

In the event of a security incident:

1. **Detection & Analysis**
   - Incident identification and classification
   - Impact assessment and severity determination
   - Evidence collection and preservation

2. **Containment**
   - Immediate threat isolation
   - Affected system quarantine
   - Implementation of temporary fixes

3. **Eradication**
   - Root cause identification
   - Malicious component removal
   - System hardening and patch application

4. **Recovery**
   - Service restoration
   - System verification
   - Security control validation

5. **Post-Incident**
   - Incident documentation
   - Lessons learned analysis
   - Security control improvements

For urgent security incidents, contact security@example.com or call our 24/7 security hotline.

## Encryption and Data Protection

### Data at Rest
- AES-256-GCM encryption for stored data
- Secure key management using hardware security modules
- Regular encryption key rotation
- Encrypted database backups

### Data in Transit
- TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- Certificate-based authentication
- Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
- Strong cipher suite enforcement

### Access Control
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews
- Automated access revocation

## Kubernetes Security

### Network Security
- Network policies for pod-to-pod communication
- Service mesh implementation with mutual TLS
- Ingress/egress traffic control
- Network segmentation and isolation

### Pod Security
- Pod security policies enforcement
- Container image scanning
- Resource quotas and limits
- Privileged container prevention

### Service Mesh
- Istio service mesh implementation
- End-to-end encryption
- Traffic management and monitoring
- Service-to-service authentication

## Security Monitoring and Auditing

### Continuous Monitoring
- Real-time security event monitoring
- Automated threat detection
- Performance and availability monitoring
- Security metrics collection

### Audit Logging
- Comprehensive audit trails
- Secure log storage and retention
- Regular log analysis
- Automated alerting for security events

## Responsible Disclosure

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Researchers who identify potential security issues should:

1. Not access or modify user data
2. Not exploit vulnerabilities beyond verification
3. Provide sufficient time for patches before disclosure
4. Submit detailed reports to security@example.com

We commit to:
- Acknowledge reports within 24 hours
- Provide regular updates on fix progress
- Not pursue legal action for responsible research
- Credit researchers (with permission) after resolution
