\- Maintain execution history for 30 days

\- Support parallel execution paths

\- Implement circuit breakers for failing services

\### Security & Compliance

System must:

\- Implement end-to-end encryption (AES-256)

\- Provide SOC 2 Type II compliance

\- Support SSO (SAML, OAuth)

\- Enable IP restriction controls

\- Maintain detailed audit logs

\- Implement role-based access control

\- Regular security scanning and penetration testing

\### Analytics & Monitoring

System must:

\- Track workflow execution metrics

\- Monitor system performance
